I am submitting my week7 solutions in this screenshot format and giving the code to where I changed in notepad because I tried to upload the whole file but I don't know first time all the files uploaded were all phantom files and wasn't opening so I deleted everything and noticed that git bash wasn't recognizing the files inside my react assignments and as the total content was around 200k I wasn't able to direct upload so that's why I chose this format to upload i am genuinely sorry if this cause inconvenience but its my only way to upload it. Hope you understand my situation.
