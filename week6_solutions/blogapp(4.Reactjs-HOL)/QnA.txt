Q: Explain the need and benefits of component life cycle
A: The React component life cycle helps manage different stages of a component's existence — mounting, updating, and unmounting. It allows developers to run code at specific points like when a component is added, updated, or removed. This improves control, performance, and data handling in applications.

Q: Identify various life cycle hook methods
A: Important life cycle methods include:

componentDidMount() – Runs after the component mounts

componentDidUpdate() – Runs after updates

componentWillUnmount() – Runs before removal

componentDidCatch() – Catches rendering errors

Q: List the sequence of steps in rendering a component
A: The typical sequence in rendering a React component is:

Constructor() – Initializes state

render() – Returns JSX to the DOM

componentDidMount() – Runs after the first render

componentDidUpdate() – Runs after any re-render

componentWillUnmount() – Cleans up before removal
