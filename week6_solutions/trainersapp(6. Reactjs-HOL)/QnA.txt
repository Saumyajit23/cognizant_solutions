Q: Explain the need and benefits of React Router
A: React Router enables navigation between different views in a single-page React application. It allows dynamic routing, maintains browser history, and prevents full-page reloads, improving performance and user experience.

Q: Identify the Components in React Router
A: Key components in React Router include:

<BrowserRouter>: The router container for the app

<Routes>: Wraps all route definitions

<Route>: Defines individual paths and components

<Link> / <NavLink>: Used for navigation

Q: List the types of Router Components
A: React Router provides several router types:

BrowserRouter: For standard web apps (uses HTML5 history API)

HashRouter: Uses the hash portion of the URL (/#/path)

MemoryRouter: Keeps routing in memory (used for testing)

Q: Parameter passing via URL
A: URL parameters can be passed using :param in the route path.
Example: <Route path="/user/:id" element={<User />} />
Inside User component, use useParams() to access id.
