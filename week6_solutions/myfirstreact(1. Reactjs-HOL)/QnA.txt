Q1: Define SPA and its benefits
A1: A Single Page Application (SPA) is a web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates content without reloading the entire page.
SPAs provide a faster, smoother user experience and reduce the load on the server by only fetching the necessary data.

Q2: Define React and identify its working
A2: React is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building interactive user interfaces.
It works by breaking the UI into reusable components and using a virtual DOM to efficiently update and render only the changed parts of the UI.

Q3: Identify the differences between SPA and MPA
A3: SPA (Single Page Application) loads a single HTML file and uses JavaScript to update content dynamically, whereas MPA (Multi Page Application) loads a new HTML file from the server for every page.
SPAs are faster and more responsive, while MPAs are better for SEO and complex websites.

Q4: Explain Pros & Cons of Single-Page Application
A4:
Pros: SPAs offer a smooth and fast user experience, reduce server requests, and provide better performance with dynamic data.
Cons: They are not SEO-friendly by default, can have slower initial load times, and may face issues with browser history and security.

Q5: Explain about React
A5: React is a component-based JavaScript library used to build fast and scalable web interfaces.
It simplifies UI development by allowing developers to create small, reusable components that manage their own state and update efficiently using the virtual DOM.

Q6: Define virtual DOM
A6: The virtual DOM is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the actual DOM in the browser.
React uses it to detect changes and update only the affected parts of the real DOM, which improves performance and rendering speed.

Q7: Explain Features of React
A7: React has several powerful features like component-based architecture, virtual DOM for faster updates, and one-way data binding.
It also supports JSX (a syntax extension for JavaScript) and allows easy integration with other libraries or frameworks.
